machine learning

types of learning
1.supervise learning-knowing the input and knowing the output.
2.unsupervise learning-not knowing the input but doin trying to predict the output.
3.reinforcement learning-learning from the past feedback.

problem in machine learning 
1.regression
2.classification
3.clustering
4.anomoly detection

regression

types:

1.simple linear regression
2.multiple linear regression
3.polynomial linear regression

simple linear regression

y=mx+c
y=dependent variable
x=independent variable
m=slope of the line
c=intercept of the line

area,price
 y=price
 x=area

machine learning modules

1.SK learn=sci kit learn

find the regression for ecommerce


CLASSIFICATION

Lgistic regression
y=1/1+e^-(mx+c)

its works on probability 0 or 1
it uses sigmoid graph

CLUSTERING(GROUPING)

k mean clustering

STEPS FOR ALGORITHM
1.find no of cluster/assume no of clusters
2.find center points of the k cluster
3.use euclaidian distance(sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y1-y2)^2
    or
 manhattan distance(|x2-x1|+|y2-y1|)
4.
